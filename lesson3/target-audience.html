        <h2 class="title">Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The page is targetting two main groups of people, both of which will be coming to the site for information.
            The first group is new buisnesses looking to connect themselves to the chamber of comerce.
            The other group is citizens who are looking to support local buisnesses.
        </p>
        <h2>Jonathan Lasseter</h2>
        <p>Jonathan is a local citizen who just recently took over his dad's bakery. His dad self promoted, 
            but Jonathan is looking to find some support in the local area. He knows many cities have a chamber of comerce.
            Jonathan wants to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. How to join the chamber</li>
                <li>2. What types of buisnesses are members</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The site needs to be clear on how to start joining, and be clear on finding which buisnesses are members
        </p>
        <h2>Susan McCreery</h2>
        <p>
            Susan has just moved to the city and is looking to support local buisnesses. She is looking for buisnesses She
            can frequent, as well as looking to see if the city has any events put on. After a quick search online, She
            finds the city chamber of comerce page.
            Susan wants to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Where the local buisnesses are located and what do they sell.</li>
                <li>2. What are local events to look forward to.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The site needs to have some basic information about it's members, as well as a place listing ongoing events.
